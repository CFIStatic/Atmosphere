# Production runbook — Work Verification

Atmosphere’s sold path is **intake → invite → Field Capture → Verifier →
evidence share**. This document is the checklist to run that path safely.
Sales, PM, estimator, and computer-use modules may stay in the tree; keep them
off or mocked until they are staffed and monitored.

## Surfaces to deploy

| Surface | Artifact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend BFF | `backend/` (`Dockerfile` or `npm run build && npm start`) | Node 22, long-lived process; needs FFmpeg for proof sparse frames |
| Office console | `frontend/` static build | Point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at the BFF |
| Field Capture | `fieldcapture/` static | Served under the same origin as the console or with `?api=` |
| Verifier | `verifier/` static | Embedded by the frontend build; also standalone |
| Marketing site | `website/` | Already CD’d to GitHub Pages |
| Native Field | `apps/field-ios/` | App Store path; uses the same BFF |

Compose sketch: `docker compose up --build` (see root `docker-compose.yml`).

## Supabase

1. Dedicated **production** project (never the shared demo URL from `.env.example`).
2. Apply migrations — see [Migration apply order](#migration-apply-order).
3. Auth → URL configuration: add the production frontend origin and password-reset redirect.
4. Storage: ensure `job-proofs` exists (migration
   `20260815180000_job_proofs_storage_bucket.sql`) with an appropriate size cap.
5. Store `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` only
   on the BFF. The browser never receives the service role.

## Required environment (BFF)

Fail-loud at boot when `NODE_ENV=production` (see `backend/src/lib/productionGuards.ts`):

| Variable | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV=production` | Enables guards, secure cookies, strips error detail |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | CORS allowlist (comma-separated) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Auth + RLS-backed reads |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | PIN unlock, signed uploads, media catalog, schedulers |
| `DEVICE_PEPPER` | PIN hashing (never store in the DB) |
| `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` / `CAREERS_TO_EMAIL` | Public site forms — **company** mailboxes only |
| `SMTP_*` + `CAREERS_FROM_EMAIL` | Atmosphere-sent invites and field OTPs |
| `MEDIA_BACKEND=supabase` | Do not use `memory` or the `s3` stub in prod |

Strongly recommended:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and/or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Verifier dictation
- `COOKIE_SECURE=true` (default when `NODE_ENV=production`)
- `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` if `BACKUP_ENABLED` is on
- `LOG_LEVEL=info` (structured JSON logs)

Escape hatches (explicit only):

- `ALLOW_MOCK_DRIVERS=true` — silences warnings for mock Xactimate / CRM / email marketing
- `ALLOW_S3_STUB=true` — permits `MEDIA_BACKEND=s3` stub (integration tests only)

Full catalogue: `backend/.env.example`.

## Migration apply order

There are **two** trees today:

1. **`backend/supabase/migrations/`** — canonical for Work Verification (jobs,
   proof, field identity, media, twins, storage).
2. **`supabase/migrations/`** — broader platform (PM, billing, sales, cyber, …).

Overlapping filenames must be byte-identical. Inventory and drift check:

```bash
npm run check:migrations --prefix backend
```

**Minimum for Work Verification:** apply every file in
`backend/supabase/migrations/` in filename order against the production
Postgres (Supabase SQL editor, `supabase db push`, or `psql`).

**Full platform:** additionally apply files that exist only under
`supabase/migrations/`. Never apply an overlapping file twice.

`db/*.sql` are reference/installers — prefer the timestamped migrations.

## Health checks

| Probe | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Liveness | `GET /api/health` | Process up (no deps) |
| Readiness | `GET /api/ready` | Supabase Auth reachable; admin/storage reported |

Point the load balancer readiness check at `/api/ready`. Prefer draining on
`SIGTERM` (schedulers and the HTTP server shut down cleanly).

## Observability

- Access logs and errors are **JSON lines** (`requestId`, `path`, `status`,
  `durationMs`). Forward stdout to your aggregator.
- Honor inbound `x-request-id` or accept the generated one on the response.
- Product telemetry (`/api/telemetry`) is not a substitute for error tracking —
  wire Sentry/OTel when you have a sink.

## CI expectations

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs:

- Backend typecheck, **tests**, build
- Frontend **tests**, build
- Agent typecheck
- Migration SQL suites + migration inventory script

Lint is still noisy across the monorepo; `npm run verify` remains the local bar.

## Go-live smoke (manual)

1. `GET /api/ready` → `status: "ready"`.
2. Sign up / sign in on the office console → create or join an org.
3. **Start a job** → approve package → send a Field Capture invite.
4. Open the invite on a phone → accept brief → record a short clip → upload.
5. Open **Verifier library** → clip appears; run dictation if keys configured.
6. Create an evidence share → open as the pinned account.
7. Confirm custody / access log entries for the share.

## What this runbook deliberately does not cover yet

- Merging the two migration trees into one (tracked as follow-up; inventory
  script prevents silent drift).
- Durable workers for proof/verification queues (still in-process `RetryQueue`).
- Real S3 multipart driver (stub only).
- Counsel-reviewed privacy/terms copy on the marketing site.
